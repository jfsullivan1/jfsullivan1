ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John Sullivan

I'm a Masters student at Brown University, and my research interest and focus is in Artificial Intelligence. 
I'm also a full-time software engineer at a government contractor, Rite-Solutions!

I'm looking to collaborate on projects for games such as mods or games themselves. Also, any machine learning project would interest me as well. I'm quite fascinated by reinforcement learning in particular.

You can reach me at john_f_sullivan@brown.edu, or my work email, jsullivan@rite-solutions.com if you have any questions or would like to request
to see my private repositories. Some of my repositories are clones of schoolwork I completed at Brown that I was specifically asked not to share publicly.
If you are a potential employer, I'd have no problem making those visible to you.

Thanks for stopping by!
